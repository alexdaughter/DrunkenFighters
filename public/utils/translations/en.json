    "us-parrafo-1": "Our band was born in Barcelona in 2019. And formed by members of the bands: “Drink Hunters”, “Brutus’ Daughters”, “Los Tronchos”, “AID” and “El Pony Pisador”. Our music is a mixture of Celtic Punk, with melodic hardcore and classic punk rock characteristics, always with a strong incline towards the melodies of the acoustic instruments. Resulting in a fast, hard and aggressive overall sound, full of harmony.",
    "us-parrafo-2": "A year ago we recorded and mastered our first album “Someday”, but with the Sars-Covid Pandemic we weren't able to work out our release date and distribution plans. After a year, we got tired of waiting, and we are looking for labels to help us release our album."
